# Contributing to NI-SystemLink-Migration

Contributions to **NI-SystemLink-Migration** are welcome from all!

**NI-SystemLink-Migration** is managed via [git](https://git-scm.com), with the canonical upstream
repository hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/ni/NI-SystemLink-Migration).

**NI-SystemLink-Migration** follows a pull-request model for development.  If you wish to
contribute, you will need to create a GitHub account, fork this project, push a
branch with your changes to your project, and then submit a pull request.

See [GitHub's official documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) for more details.

## Development
### Getting started
To get the source code for this tool, simply clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ni/NI-SystemLink-Migration.git
cd NI-SystemLink-Migration
```
This tool uses poetry to manage project dependencies, install poetry using:
```bash
pip install poetry
```
To install the dependencies for the migration tool project, run:
```bash
poetry install
```
Finally, to run the tool while developing, use the poetry `run` command:
```bash
poetry run nislmigrate
```
### Running tests
The unit tests in this repository can be executed using:
```bash
poetry run task test
```
### Code style
The python code style in this repository adheres to the `flake8` linters default and uses `mypy` to check types hints. Linting can be run on the repository using:"
```bash
poetry run task lint
```

### Extensibility
Additional backup/restore strategies can be easily added using the `ServicePlugin` abstract base class:
1. Add a new python class to the `plugins` module that implements the `ServicePlugin` class:

```python
from nislmigrate.extensibility.migrator_plugin import MigratorPlugin
from nislmigrate.facades.facade_factory import FacadeFactory


class CustomMigrator(MigratorPlugin):

    @property
    def names(self):
        return ["custom-migration", "cm"]

    @property
    def help(self):
        return "Performs some custom migration action"

    def capture(self, migration_directory: str, migrator_factory: FacadeFactory):
        pass

    def restore(self, migration_directory: str, migrator_factory: FacadeFactory):
        pass
```
The migration tool will now run the `capture` or `restore` method of your custom migration strategy if run with the custom flag:
```bash
poetry run nislmigrate capture --custom-migration
poetry run nislmigrate restore --custom-migration
```
